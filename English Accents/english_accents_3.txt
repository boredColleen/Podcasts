English Accents

Episode 3: Shakespeare and Early Modern English: A Language Transformed

Colleen: Hey everyone! Welcome back to another episode of "English Accents." I'm Colleen, your go-to gal for all things English with a twist of today’s lingo. And as always, I'm joined by my awesome friends, Henry and Ishani. How’s it going, guys?

Henry: Cheers, Colleen! Delighted to be here, as always.

Ishani: Hey everyone! Ready to dive into some Shakespearean shenanigans.

Colleen: Oh my gosh, Shakespeare! The dude who basically invented half the words we use today. So, let’s jump right into it. How did Shakespeare transform the English language?

Henry: Indeed, Colleen. William Shakespeare wasn’t just a playwright; he was a linguistic pioneer. He introduced countless words and phrases that we still use today. Words like "eyeball," "bedroom," and phrases like "break the ice" all have his fingerprints on them.

Ishani: Yeah, it's wild to think that some of our everyday language comes from someone who was writing in iambic pentameter. Imagine ordering a coffee and saying, "I’d like to break the ice with a latte," thanks to Shakespeare!

Colleen: Haha, that would definitely make for an interesting barista encounter! But seriously, Shakespeare was creating new words on the fly. It’s like he was the original trendsetter for the English language.

Henry: Quite right. And let's not forget the impact of the printing press during his time. It allowed his works to be distributed widely, which helped standardize English to some extent. Though, regional dialects were still very much alive and kicking.

Ishani: Speaking of dialects, Shakespeare’s plays were performed all over England, each with its own accent. So, you had actors from different regions bringing their unique flavors to his works. It’s like the original remix culture.

Colleen: That’s so cool! So, Shakespeare’s plays were like the Spotify playlists of Early Modern English, mixing different accents and styles. But Henry, you always have those British gems. Can you share a classic British saying that ties into this?

Henry: Certainly! As the saying goes, "Manners maketh man." It highlights the importance of etiquette, which was quite significant during Shakespeare’s era. It’s a timeless piece of wisdom that still resonates today.

Ishani: Love that! And it's funny because while Shakespeare was busy crafting his masterpieces, the Great Vowel Shift was still shaking things up. This was a major change in how vowels were pronounced, which is why English spelling can be so... unpredictable.

Colleen: Oh, the Great Vowel Shift! So that’s why "bite" doesn’t rhyme with "site" the way it used to. It’s like English decided to switch things up on us just when we were getting comfortable.

Henry: Precisely. The Great Vowel Shift was a gradual change in pronunciation that occurred between the 15th and 18th centuries. It’s one of the reasons why English spelling and pronunciation can be so tricky.

Ishani: And amidst all this change, Shakespeare was like, "Hold my quill," and just started inventing words and phrases. It’s no wonder he’s still celebrated today.

Colleen: Totally! But here’s a twist for you guys—did you know that some of Shakespeare’s invented words were initially considered incorrect? It’s like he was the original rebel breaking all the grammar rules.

Henry: Indeed, he pushed the boundaries of the language. But rather than being scolded, many of his creations were embraced and became part of everyday speech. A true testament to his genius.

Ishani: It’s fascinating how one person’s creativity can have such a lasting impact. Imagine if Shakespeare were around today—what new words or phrases would he create?

Colleen: Maybe something like "selfie" or "ghosting"! Although, knowing Shakespeare, he’d probably come up with something way more poetic.

Henry: Perhaps "solitary reflection" instead of "selfie." Although, I must admit, "selfie" does have a certain charm.

Ishani: Either way, Shakespeare’s legacy lives on every time we use those words and phrases. It’s like he’s still with us, quietly influencing our conversations.

Colleen: Absolutely! So, to wrap things up, Shakespeare didn’t just write plays; he shaped the very language we speak today. From new words to standardized grammar, his influence is undeniable.

Henry: A true luminary of the English language, indeed.

Ishani: And it’s pretty amazing to think about how diverse and dynamic English was even back then. Makes you appreciate the language even more.

Colleen: Totally agree! Alright, team, any final thoughts before we sign off?

Henry: Just that understanding the roots of our language makes me even more proud of my British heritage.

Ishani: And it gives me plenty of material for witty remarks in our next episodes. Win-win!
