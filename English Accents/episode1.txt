Podcast Episode 1: The Mystery of the Lost Notebook

Bored Colleen

Colleen: Hey everyone! Welcome to the very first episode of Bored Colleen. I'm Colleen, and since I've got nothing better to do, I've roped in my besties Henry and Ishani. Say hi, guys!

Henry: Cheers, everyone! Delighted to be here, I suppose.

Ishani: Hiya! Let's make this fun!

Colleen: So, you won't believe what happened to me yesterday. It's absolutely insane!

Ishani: Ooh, this sounds juicy! Spill it!

Henry: Knowing you, Colleen, it's bound to be a cracking tale.

Colleen: Alright, so I was at the campus café, sipping my usual latte, when I spotted this old, battered notebook just lying on a table. No one was around, so I picked it up.

Ishani: Mysterious notebook? Classic start to an adventure!

Henry: Or the beginning of a dodgy situation. Proceed with caution.

Colleen: Haha, very funny. Anyway, I opened it up, and it's filled with sketches and cryptic messages. Looks like some kind of treasure map.

Ishani: No way! Are we talking real-life treasure hunt?

Henry: Blimey, that's straight out of a novel!

Colleen: Exactly! So, naturally, I thought we should check it out. I mean, we're all bored, right?

Ishani: Count me in! What's the first clue?

Colleen: The first page had this riddle: "In the place where minds take flight, seek the book that hides in sight."

Henry: "Where minds take flight"... Sounds like the library.

Ishani: Or maybe the rooftop garden where people go to daydream.

Colleen: I was thinking the library too. So, we headed there.

Ishani: And did you find anything?

Colleen: Oh, we did. Hidden behind a copy of The Invisible Man was another note.

Henry: This is getting rather intriguing.

Colleen: The next clue said, "Find the art that moves with grace, where time stands still in mirrored space."

Ishani: That's got to be the dance studio!

Henry: Or perhaps the art gallery?

Colleen: We checked the dance studio first.

Ishani: And there, taped to the mirror, was another clue!

Henry: This is turning into quite the escapade.

Colleen: The final clue led us to the old clock tower on campus. When we got there, we found a small box with the initials "B.C." engraved on it.

Ishani: "B.C."? Like "Bored Colleen"?

Henry: Or "Before Coffee"? Which is how you live most mornings.

Colleen: Very funny, Henry. But yeah, "B.C."—just like the name of this podcast.

Ishani: This is too perfect to be a coincidence.

Colleen: So, I opened the box, and inside was... a key.

Henry: A key to what?

Colleen: That's the mystery! There's no label, no additional clues, nothing.

Ishani: Maybe it's not over yet.

Colleen: Exactly! Just when we thought the adventure was wrapping up, it gets deeper.

Henry: Hold on a tick. There's something engraved on the key.

Colleen: What? How did I miss that?

Henry: Probably too gobsmacked by the whole thing.

Ishani: It looks like coordinates!

Colleen: Seriously? Let's check it out.

Henry: According to my phone, these coordinates point to... the old warehouse by the river.

Ishani: That's a bit sketchy.

Colleen: Maybe we should just leave it.

Henry: Or maybe that's exactly what they want us to think.

Ishani: I'm game if you are.

Colleen: You know what? Let's go. What's life without a little risk?

—That evening—

Colleen: So, we get to the warehouse, and it's dark and empty. But then, the lights flicker on, and suddenly, all our friends jump out shouting...

Ishani: Surprise!

Henry: Happy Birthday!

Colleen: Wait, what? My birthday isn't until next week!

Ishani: We know! That's the twist!

Henry: Thought we'd catch you off guard.

Colleen: You guys planned this whole scavenger hunt?

Ishani: Guilty as charged. We knew you were bored, so we wanted to spice things up.

Henry: And throw you an early birthday bash!

Colleen: You sneaky masterminds! This is the best surprise ever!

Ishani: And the key? It opens that box over there.

Colleen: Opens the box Oh my gosh, it's tickets to that concert I've been dying to go to!

Henry: Front row seats, mate.

Colleen: I can't believe this! You guys are the absolute best.

Ishani: Anything for our favorite bored friend.

Colleen: Wait, but whose notebook was that?

Henry: Ah, that belongs to Professor Thompson. He was in on it too.

Colleen: No way! How did you convince him?

Ishani: Let's just say extra credit works wonders.

Colleen: This just keeps getting better.

Henry: So, how's that for a twist ending?

Colleen: Absolutely epic. You've officially cured my boredom.

Ishani: Mission accomplished!

Colleen: Alright, that's all for today's episode, folks. Turns out, my boredom led to the most amazing surprise ever. Thanks for tuning in!

Ishani: Bye, everyone! Keep life exciting!

Henry: Cheers! Until next time.

Colleen: Stay curious and embrace the unexpected. Catch you later on Bored Colleen!
