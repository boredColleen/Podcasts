Hey there! Welcome to Swiftian—your new best friend for learning how to code and actually building something real. Coding can feel overwhelming, right? You need a MacBook, tons of tutorials, and hours of practice before even thinking about launching an app. And let’s be real, those “no-code” tools? They’re fun but not real coding.
