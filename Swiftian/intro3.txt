Alright, so you’ve gone through the tutorial, learned the ropes… now what? Time to break free and code on your own!

This is where File Explorer comes in. Think of it as your personal coding space—a playground where you can experiment, break things, and build whatever you want.

You can import functions you wrote in the tutorial and use them in your own projects. Wanna make a mini-game? A simple utility app? Go for it! You’re not just following instructions anymore—you’re coding like a real developer.

And here’s the cool part: this space is only going to get bigger and better. Future updates will let you connect this with Other Features for even more advanced tools.
